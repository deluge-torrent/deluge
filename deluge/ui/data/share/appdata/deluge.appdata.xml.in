  <description>
    <_p>Deluge contains the common features to BitTorrent clients such as Protocol Encryption, DHT, Local Peer Discovery (LSD), Peer Exchange (PEX), UPnP, NAT-PMP, Proxy support, Web seeds, global and per-torrent speed limits. As Deluge heavily utilises the ​libtorrent library it has a comprehensive list of the ​features provided.</_p>
    <_p>Deluge has been designed to run as both a normal standalone desktop application and as a ​client-server. In Thinclient mode a Deluge daemon handles all the BitTorrent activity and is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces connecting remotely from any other platform.</_p>
