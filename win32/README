== Build Steps ==
Note: With both options they assume you installed the above to default dir/drives.
    And that you choose to add python to your path environment variable during install.
    If you did not, then adjust accordingly.
Option A:
1. Install all of the above dependencies and run the pip command.
2. Extract the source tarball in this example well use "C:\Deluge" then run the following commands:
    cd C:\Deluge
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    cd win32
    python deluge-bbfreeze.py
    CD ..
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\makensis" deluge-win32-installer.nsi
3. Your installer will be in build-win32.

Option B:
1. Run makeinstaller.bat.(might need to run as admin)
2. Your installer will be in build-win32.

== Automate Steps ==
Note: The build proccess will run once everyday at 8:00AM till 31/12/2100.
    Also this will clean build directory's before each build so remember to copy your installer after
    or add a "copy *source* *destination*" line to the bat file to automate this.
    This process assumes you not only meet the build steps requirments but also
    have git installed and in your system "path" environment variable.
1. Run once in cmd:
    cd C:\
    git clone https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge
2. Run once in cmd:
    schtasks /create /tn DailyDelugeBuilds /tr c:\deluge\win32\makenightlyinstaller.bat /sc daily /st 08:00 /ed 31/12/2100
3. From now all builds will be made automatically(until year 2100) no need to re-run above commands.
