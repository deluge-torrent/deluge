== Build Steps ==
Note: With both options they assume you installed the above to default dir/drives.
    And that you choose to add python to your path environment variable during install.
    If you did not, then adjust accordingly.
Option A:
1. Install all of the above dependencies and run the pip command.
2. Extract the source tarball in this example well use "C:\Deluge" then run the following commands:
    cd C:\Deluge
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    cd win32
    python deluge-bbfreeze.py
    CD ..
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\makensis" deluge-win32-installer.nsi
3. Your installer will be in build-win32.

Option B:
1. Run makeinstaller.bat.(might need to run as admin)
2. Your installer will be in build-win32.

== Automate Steps ==
Note: The build proccess will run once everyday at 8:00AM till 31/12/2100.
    Also this will clean build directory's before each build so remember to copy your installer after
    or add a "copy *source* *destination*" line to the bat file to automate this.
1. Run:
    schtasks /create /tn DailyDelugeBuilds /tr c:\deluge\win32\makeinstaller.bat /sc daily /st 08:00 /ed 31/12/2100
