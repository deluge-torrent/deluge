================================= 
Installation of pytorrent
=================================

Compile:         python setup.py build
Compile&install: sudo python setup.py install

Dependencies to compile (written as Ubuntu packages): python, libboost-filesystem1.33.1, libboost-date-time1.33.1, libboost-program-options1.33.1, libboost-regex1.33.1, libboost-thread1.33.1, libc6-dev, zlib1g-dev

May also depend on (not sure): python-dev, and -dev packages for all boost libs

Note: Makefile.libtorrent-only.* are the makefiles from libtorrent, copies as it. They don't refer to pytorrent, and probably won't work in the current directory structure. However, they may help people know what dependencies etc. are needed
