The simplest way to use this project is to install the .deb file,
which appears in the "debs" subfolder. This was tested under
Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper), but may work in other Debian-based systems.

Otherwise, you may compile the code with the script 'makeit'. The
script 'installit' will install the package, so you can import it as
a module under python.

After installation of python-libtorrent, you can install and run
Deluge, http://code.google.com/p/deluge-torrent/

As a simpler test, you can check whether python-libtorrent works by
by running

python test.py

This does a simple torrent download. Note that the torrent is for
the Ubuntu 6.06 release, and was available as of 15.9.2006. You
may need to replace the torrent with another.

If successful, you will see test.py print the torrent status
to the screen each second. Notice in particular the download speed
and amount downloaded so far, to see if things are working.

Note: You may need to change the port used, depending on your system.
