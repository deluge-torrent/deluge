=== Deluge 1.4.0 (In Development) ===
	* Improved Logging
	* Removed the AutoAdd feature on the core. It's now handled with the AutoAdd
	plugin, which is also shipped with Deluge, and it does a better job and
	now, it even supports multiple users perfectly.
	* Authentication/Permission exceptions are now sent to clients and recreated
	there to allow acting upon them.
	* Enforced the use of the "deluge.plugins" namespace to reduce package
	names clashing beetween regular packages and deluge plugins.

==== Core ====
	* Make the distinction between adding to the session new unmanaged torrents
	and torrents loaded from state. This will break backwards compatability.
	* Pass a copy of an event instead of passing the event arguments to the
	event handlers. This will break backwards compatability.
	* Allow changing ownership of torrents.
	* File modifications on the auth file are now detected and when they happen,
	the file is reloaded. Upon finding an old auth file with an old format, an
	upgrade to the new format is made, file saved, and reloaded.
	* Authentication no longer requires a username/password. If one or both of
	these is missing, an authentication error will be sent to the client
	which sould then ask the username/password to the user.
	* Implemented sequential downloads.
	* #378: Provide information about a torrent's pieces states

==== GtkUI ====
	* Fix uncaught exception when closing deluge in classic mode
	* Allow changing ownership of torrents
	* Host entries in the Connection Manager UI are now editable. They're
	now also migrated from the old format were automatic localhost logins were
	possible, which no longer is, this fixes #1814.
	* Implemented sequential downloads UI handling.
	* #378: Allow showing a pieces bar instead of a regular progress bar in a
	torrent's status tab.
	* #2093: Make torrent opening compatible with all unicode paths.
	* #1084: Fix magnet association button on Windows

==== WebUI ====
	* Server (deluge-web) now daemonizes by default, use -d or --do-not-daemonize to disable.

==== Blocklist Plugin ====
	* #1382: Implemented whitelist support to both core and GTK UI.
	* Implemented ip filter cleaning before each update. Restarting the deluge
	daemon is no longer needed.
	* If "check_after_days" is 0(zero), the timer is not started anymore. It
	would keep updating one call after the other. If the value changed, the
	timer is now stopped and restarted using the new value.
