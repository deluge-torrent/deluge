# Installing Deluge

These are the instructions for installing Deluge. Consider them a work-in-progress and
feel free to make suggestions for improvement.

## <i class="icon-ubuntu"></i> Ubuntu

### PPA

Until the stable PPA is updated, the development version of Deluge can be used:

    sudo add-apt-repository -u ppa:deluge-team/stable
    sudo apt install deluge

### <i class="icon-python"></i> PyPi

To install from Python PyPi, Deluge requires the following system installed packages:

    sudo apt install python3-pip python3-libtorrent python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-appindicator3

Install with pip:

    pip install deluge

## <i class="fa fa-windows"></i> Windows

Unfortunately due to move to GTK3 and Python 3 there is no installer package currently
available for Windows.

Intrepid users can install Deluge from seperate packages as detailed in [issue #3201].

## <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> macOS

There is no `.app` package currently for macOS, but can try Deluge with homebrew.

1.  Install [Homebrew]
2.  Open a terminal.
3.  Run the following to install required packages:

        brew install pygobject3 gtk+3 adwaita-icon-theme
        brew install libtorrent-rasterbar

4.  To fix translations:

        brew link gettext --force

5.  Install Deluge:

        pip3 install deluge
